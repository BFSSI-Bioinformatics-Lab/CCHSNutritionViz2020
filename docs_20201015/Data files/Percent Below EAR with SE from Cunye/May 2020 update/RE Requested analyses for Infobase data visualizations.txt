Hi Julie;

    For percentage of total energy intake from carbohydrate,  I updated the estimates for 
Males & Females combined 19+ at provincial level. Please use the update estimates for 
the visualizations and ignore the data I sent to you before. Sorry about this.

Thanks a lot.

Cunye

Hi Ali,

Thanks! I hope all is well with you too.

There is no big rush on this. It will be used for the visualizations for the PHAC infobase and it doesn’t 
look like we will be able to publish anything for that in the foreseeable future. We are trying to get 
everything as far along as possible so that we are ready once we get the go ahead. For now, I can just 
tell Forest that we will have some extra data to add in at a later date. It can wait until the premarket 
submissions are complete.

Julie

Hi Julie and Cunye, 

I hope everything is going well on your ends.

I haven't forgotten about new analysis for compendium. I have been busy with some premarket 
submissions with tight deadlines. I will get back to you soon. 

Please let me know when the deadline for sending you new results is.

Thanks,
Ali

Hi Julie;
 
   Estimates for the required nutrients except Iron is attached. Ali will provide the 
estimates for Iron. Each nutrient has three excel sheets. First sheet contains the 
estimates for Males 19+, Females 19+ and Males & Females combined 19+. Second 
sheet contains the estimates for Children 1 to 8 years (males & females combined). 
Third sheet contains the estimates for Children 9 to 18 years (males & females 
combined).
 
Some notes:
 
Percentage of total energy intake from carbohydrates: I did modification the 
estimates for Males & Females combined 19+ at provincial level.
 
Magnesium: I round off to three decimal digits for the estimates of the Children 1 to 8 
years (males & females combined) because the estimates of % < EAR is too small. If 
you want to round off to one or two decimal digits, feel   
                        free to do . 
 
Vitamin B6: I round off to three decimal digits for the estimates of the Children 1 to 8 
years (males & females combined) because the estimates of % < EAR is too small. If 
you want to round off to one or two decimal digits, feel   
                        free to do . 
 
Zinc: I round off to three decimal digits for the estimates of the Children 1 to 8 years 
(males & females combined) because the estimates of % < EAR is too small. If you 
want to round off to one or two decimal digits, feel   
                        free to do . 
 
 
If you have any question or need more information, please let me know.
 
Thanks a lot.
 
Cunye
